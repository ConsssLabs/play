## Overview

**ConSSS Wars** is a browser-first, web3-second tactics RPG. The full game plays
in any modern browser with no install and **no wallet required**. Connect a Sui
wallet and your results stop being throwaway: clear a battle and you can mint a
**Chronicle** — a Sui NFT that records *which* battle you cleared, *how well* you
fought (an on-chain tier), and a personal long-form saga you author, with the
saga JSON stored on **Walrus**.

This repo packages a [Godot 4.6](https://godotengine.org) HTML5 export together
with a vanilla-JS Sui + Walrus dApp bridge, and serves both from **Cloudflare
Pages** with a Pages Function handling the heavy lifting (binary streaming, a
Tatum-keyed RPC proxy, and an anti-cheat mint voucher).

## Features

**Gameplay**
- Turn-based tactical combat with multi-phase boss fights and mid-battle events.
- Painterly, hand-drawn art direction and an original score.
- Fully playable in the browser — no install, no wallet required.

**On-chain (optional, opt-in)**
- **Connect any Sui wallet** — Slush, Sui Wallet, Suiet and other
  [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard) wallets.
  First-party page, no popup blocking.
- **Tiered Chronicle NFTs** — clearing a battle mints a Chronicle whose rank is
  computed **on-chain** from a per-battle clear counter and your remaining HP.
- **Mint integrity** — every mint is gated by an authority-signed ed25519
  voucher, so a Chronicle cannot be granted by hand-crafting a transaction.
- **Walrus sagas** — the chronicle JSON (battle log + long-form text) is uploaded
  to Walrus; only its blob id is pinned on-chain as `metadata_blob_id`.

## Hackathon integration points

This build integrates two of the track technologies as **core functionality**,
not decoration. The table maps each to exactly where it is used in this repo.

| Technology | Role | Where (browser side) | Where (server side) | Endpoint(s) used |
|------------|------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Walrus** (decentralized storage) | Stores the player's Chronicle metadata JSON off-chain; only the returned blob id is pinned on-chain. | `bridge/src/walrus.js` — `uploadString()` **PUTs** the chronicle JSON to a Walrus **publisher** and returns a `blobId`; `fetchString()` / `blobUrl()` resolve it back from a Walrus **aggregator** (also used for NFT Display `image_url`). Exposed as `window.consss.uploadToWalrus` / `readFromWalrus`. | None — the publisher pays for storage, so no server proxy and no extra wallet tx are needed. | Publisher `PUT {publisherUrl}/v1/blobs?epochs={n}` · Aggregator `GET {aggregatorUrl}/v1/blobs/{blobId}` |
| **Tatum API** (Sui RPC gateway) | The track's RPC gateway for all Sui JSON-RPC reads (owned-object queries, etc.). | `bridge/src/sui-client.js` — `SuiClient` is pointed at the **same-origin** `/rpc` path (`config.rpcProxyPath`), never at Tatum directly. The Tatum key is never in the browser bundle. | `functions/[[path]].js` (`/rpc` branch) injects the **Tatum** API key as an `x-api-key` header server-side, forwards to the Tatum gateway, and **falls back to the public Sui fullnode** on any error. | `POST /rpc` → `https://sui-mainnet.gateway.tatum.io` (key from `TATUM_API_KEY`) → public fullnode fallback |

**Mainnet Walrus endpoints** (from `bridge/config.public.js`): publisher
`https://walrus-publisher.rubynodes.io`, aggregator
`https://aggregator.walrus-mainnet.walrus.space`, `storageEpochs = 5`.

> **Why the community rubynodes publisher?** Mysten does not run a free public
> **publisher** on Walrus mainnet (writes cost storage), so the bridge uses the
> community **rubynodes** publisher for uploads. Reads use the standard Walrus
> mainnet **aggregator**. Both are plain HTTP — the documented Walrus Web API
> pattern — so no client-side encoding or extra wallet signature is required.

## Architecture

A Godot 4 HTML5 export produces two binaries far larger than Cloudflare Pages'
per-file limit, so the build is split across hosts and stitched back together at
the edge. The browser only ever talks to `play.conssswars.com`.

```
                         play.conssswars.com  (Cloudflare Pages)
   browser ──────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────
                                      │
   public/  (static shell, < 2 MB)    │  functions/[[path]].js  (Pages Function)
   • index.html                       │  • /index.wasm ┐ proxied + edge-cached
   • index.js loader + audio worklets │  • /index.pck  ┘ from GitHub Releases
   • dist/ wallet bridge bundle       │      (same-origin; fixes CORS + Content-Type)
   • _headers · _redirects            │  • /rpc          → Tatum (server key) → public RPC
                                      │  • /mint-voucher → ed25519 voucher (anti-cheat)
                                      │
            GitHub Releases (ConsssLab/play, releases/latest/download):
                       index.pck (~385 MB) + index.wasm (~36 MB)

   Walrus (no proxy): browser ── PUT ──▶ rubynodes publisher  (write saga JSON)
                      browser ── GET ──▶ walrus-mainnet aggregator (read saga JSON)
```

What each piece does:

- **Static shell on Pages** — `index.html`, the Godot loader (`index.js`), the
  two audio worklets, the icon, and the built wallet bridge bundle.
- **Engine binaries on GitHub Releases** — `index.pck` (~385 MB) and
  `index.wasm` (~36 MB) exceed both Cloudflare Pages' 25 MiB/file limit and
  GitHub's 100 MB git limit, so each deploy uploads them as Release assets.
- **The Pages Function stitches it together** (`functions/[[path]].js`):
  - **Binary proxy** — a plain redirect to GitHub fails CORS (release assets send
    no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`), so the Function fetches `index.wasm` /
    `index.pck` from `releases/latest/download/` server-side and streams them back
    **same-origin** with the correct `Content-Type` (so WASM streaming
    compilation works). It **edge-caches** them under a version-stamped key that
    the deploy script bumps per release, so repeat loads are fast and a new
    release retires the old cached bytes automatically.
  - **`/rpc`** — a Sui JSON-RPC proxy. The browser's `SuiClient` POSTs here; the
    Function injects the **Tatum** API key (`x-api-key`) server-side and forwards,
    falling back to the public Sui fullnode on any failure.
  - **`/mint-voucher`** — signs an authority ed25519 voucher binding the mint to
    `(registry, player, battle, hero, hp_pct, nonce, expiry)`. See
    [Security model](#security-model).
- **Single-threaded export** — cross-origin isolation is intentionally disabled
  (`ensureCrossOriginIsolationHeaders: false`, no COOP/COEP), so no
  SharedArrayBuffer setup is needed and the cross-origin engine load is not
  blocked. *Keep the Godot export single-threaded or this hosting model breaks.*

### dApp bridge

`bridge/` builds a vanilla-JS (no React, no dapp-kit) bundle that exposes
`window.consss = { connect, mint, uploadToWalrus, readFromWalrus,
getOwnedChronicles }` so the Godot HTML5 shell can drive Sui + Walrus via
`JavaScriptBridge`. The mint flow is:

1. Upload the chronicle JSON to **Walrus** (publisher HTTP API) → get a blob id.
2. `POST /mint-voucher` with the clear report → get an authority-signed voucher.
3. Build and sign `chronicle::chronicle::mint_chronicle` with the player's own
   wallet, passing the report + voucher + `metadata_blob_id`; the tier is
   computed on-chain. The server never holds player funds.

`bridge/config.public.js` contains **only public on-chain data** (network,
package/registry IDs, Walrus endpoints, `/rpc` path) — no secrets — and is safe
to commit and ship in the browser bundle.

## Configuration

### Public config (committed)

`bridge/config.public.js` — network, RPC proxy path, on-chain IDs, and Walrus
endpoints. Public data only; bundled into the browser. See
[On-chain deployments](#on-chain-deployments).

### Server-side secrets (Cloudflare only)

Secrets live **only** as Cloudflare Pages environment variables / bindings on the
`consss-play` project and are read solely inside the Pages Function. They are
never bundled, never committed, never shipped to the browser.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `TATUM_API_KEY` | yes | Tatum Sui gateway key injected into `/rpc` (falls back to public RPC if unset/failing). |
| `AUTHORITY_PRIVKEY_HEX` | yes | ed25519 private key that signs `/mint-voucher` vouchers. |
| `CHRONICLE_REGISTRY_ID` | yes | Registry id the voucher is bound to (anti cross-deployment replay). |
| `CHRONICLE_TYPE` | optional | Chronicle struct type (`0x<pkg>::chronicle::Chronicle`) — enables the progression gate. |
| `MINT_KV` | optional | KV binding for the per-`(wallet, battle)` mint rate limit. |
| `TATUM_RPC_URL` / `PUBLIC_RPC_URL` | optional | Override the default mainnet Tatum / public fullnode endpoints. |

> Deploying also requires a Cloudflare API token at `~/.cf_token` (Pages → Edit)
> and the account id via `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` or `~/.cf_account`. These are
> local-only and never enter git. The token should be deleted/revoked after use.

## Security model

This is an honest, scoped model: a fully client-side game can never make the
client untrusted by itself, so we are explicit about what the current defenses
**do** guarantee, what they **don't yet**, and why that trade-off is acceptable
today.

### Defenses we have today

- **No secrets in the browser.** The Tatum API key and the voucher authority
  ed25519 signing key are Cloudflare **runtime secrets**, read only inside the
  Pages Function. Local deploys read a Cloudflare API token from a deploy-only
  `~/.cf_token`. None of these are ever in the committed browser bundle —
  `config.public.js` holds public IDs/URLs only. Rotating a key is a dashboard
  change, no rebuild.
- **Same-origin `/rpc` proxy.** The browser POSTs to `/rpc`; the Function
  attaches the Tatum key server-side and forwards, falling back to the public
  fullnode. The key never reaches the browser and there is no CORS surface.
- **Single mint chokepoint.** `/mint-voucher` is the *only* way to obtain a valid
  voucher, and the on-chain contract **rejects any mint without one**. So even
  though anyone can craft a Sui transaction, nobody can mint a Chronicle without
  going through our server. It signs an ed25519 voucher over `(registry, player,
  battle, hero, hp_pct, nonce, expiry)`; the contract verifies signature, sender,
  nonce (anti-replay), expiry, and computes the tier itself. Players sign the
  mint with their own wallet.
- **Layer-1 anti-scripting guards** on `/mint-voucher`:
  - **Origin check** — only requests from `https://play.conssswars.com` are
    served (filters casual `curl` / foreign-site scripting).
  - **KV rate limit** — a per-`(wallet, battle)` cooldown via the `MINT_KV`
    binding, throttling automated re-requests.
  - **Progression gate** — battle *N* requires already owning the battle *N-1*
    Chronicle (queried via RPC), so the sequence can't be skipped.
  - Rate limit and progression gate are **graceful** — they skip cleanly if
    `MINT_KV` / `CHRONICLE_TYPE` are unset.
- **Versioned edge caching** of the engine binaries, so a new release retires
  old cached bytes by key bump (no broad cache-purge token scope needed).

### What we do NOT (yet) do — stated plainly

The Layer-1 guards plus the voucher chokepoint give us **anti-scripting**: they
stop casual automation and they stop hand-crafted-PTB mints that bypass the
server. They do **not** stop a determined player from driving the real client
and reporting a *favorable* result, because `/mint-voucher` still **trusts the
client-reported `hp_pct` / `battle_id`**. There is no server-authoritative
simulation today, so that is the documented ceiling of the current design.

**Why we accept this for now.** Every mint costs **real Sui mainnet gas**, paid
by the attacker, and the reward is a collectible NFT — there is no token,
yield, or marketplace value to extract. For a small project, the cost and effort
of a sophisticated client-tampering exploit is high relative to that reward, so
hardening past anti-scripting is not yet worth it. We chose to ship an honest
chokepoint now rather than over-build.

### Planned future anti-cheat ("no real play, no mint")

The next hardening step makes the result **server-verified** instead of
client-trusted, in two layers:

1. **Server-authoritative validation** — the backend deterministically
   **re-simulates / replays** the battle from a server-seeded start using the
   recorded player inputs, and only issues a voucher if the replayed outcome
   matches the claimed `hp_pct` / clear.
2. **zk-proof of correct play** — a zero-knowledge proof that a valid play
   session produced the claimed result, so the server can verify *without*
   trusting (or even re-running) the raw client trace.

**Importantly, neither requires a smart-contract change.** The voucher interface
(`mint_chronicle` + the signed message format) stays exactly as it is today; only
the **backend's decision to sign** gets stricter. That keeps this upgrade path
fully forward-compatible with the deployed mainnet package.

## Local development

Prerequisites: Node 18+ and (for serving Functions locally) `wrangler`.

```bash
# Build the wallet bridge bundle into public/dist/
cd bridge
npm install
npm run build          # or: npm run build:watch

# Serve the static shell + Pages Function locally
cd ..
npx wrangler pages dev public
```

Notes:
- The engine binaries (`index.wasm`, `index.pck`) are **not** in this repo; they
  are served from GitHub Releases in production. To run the full game locally,
  drop a fresh Godot Web export's `index.wasm` / `index.pck` into `public/`.
- For the wallet/mint/RPC paths to work locally, provide the server env vars
  above to `wrangler pages dev` (e.g. via `--binding` / a `.dev.vars` file).

## Deployment

Deploys are **manual by design** — a human gate against shipping a bad build, and
the Cloudflare token never lives in GitHub. One command runs the whole pipeline:

```bash
# 1. In Godot: export the "Web" preset (keep thread support OFF) to
#    ../app/exports/web/  (override the path as an arg if different)

# 2. From this repo root:
scripts/deploy.sh [EXPORT_DIR]   # default EXPORT_DIR = ../app/exports/web
```

`scripts/deploy.sh` will:
1. Copy the fresh export's loader + audio worklets into `public/` (the committed
   `index.icon.png` is intentionally kept).
2. Build the wallet bridge (no secrets baked in).
3. Upload `index.wasm` + `index.pck` to a timestamped GitHub Release.
4. Stamp the Function's edge-cache version with the release tag (automatic
   cache-bust), then restore the working tree afterward.
5. `wrangler pages deploy public` → the `consss-play` project.
6. Verify `/`, `/index.wasm`, `/index.pck` over HTTPS.

**One-time setup:** create the `consss-play` Pages project, set the server env
vars from [Configuration](#configuration), and point the custom domain
`play.conssswars.com` at the project. Remember to `rm -f ~/.cf_token` and revoke
the token when finished.

The built bridge (`public/dist/`) and the engine binaries (`*.wasm`, `*.pck`)
are gitignored: the bridge is built at deploy time, the binaries live in Releases.
